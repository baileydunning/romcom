# RomCom Paired Project

## Project Description
This was a paired project where we built out a RomCom book cover generator. It gives the user the ability to randomly generate from a pre-determined list of images, titles & descriptors or can customize and create their own cover by uploading an image/writing a title and descriptors. The user is able to save and delete covers.

## Learning Goals
* Expand our understanding of the DOM (Document Object Model) and how it differs from updating the data model
* Git workflow collaboration
* Use Classes to manipulate and pass data
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

## Planning
* Utilize a GitHub project board to organize each iteration into digestible parts

### Challenges
* Switching between driver/navigator
* Using Git workflow/multiple branches effectively
* Working remote

### Wins
* Keeping a small number of global variables as our data model while still having intended functionality
* Collaboration & communication was smooth (thanks to a thoughtful DTR)
* Finished iteration 5 a few days before the deadline

## Functionality
* On load & when "Show New Random Cover" is clicked, a random RomCom cover will be displayed
* Able to toggle between Home view, Make Your Own Cover view & Saved Covers view
* A user can create their own customized cover by inserting information into the form
* A user can temporarily save covers to the Saved Covers view by clicking "Save Cover"
* A user can view Saved Covers and delete them permanently via double click on the cover
